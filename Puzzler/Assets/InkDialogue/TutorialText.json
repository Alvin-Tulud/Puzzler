That's where you come in!","\n","^I'll be needing you to help me fix up these factories and test em by running potion recipes.","\n","^Sound complicated? It might be!","\n","^BUT!

That's pretty important..","\n","^That giant unending grey void is where you get your tiles from.","\n","^they uh","\n","^you know","\n","^get that flask moving around the map!","\n","^When you click on a tile, you can press the R key or the right mouse button to rotate it.","\n","^Different tiles can have different effects on the flask, depending on what you use.","\n","^Like here! These will fill up the flask by one increment.","\n","^The flask can hold up to 4 increments of color!","\n","^And don't worry about overflow, since the flask won't take any new colors in once it's full...","\n","^Oh, and if you placed a tile you didn't need to, you can just drag it right over to that red trash can icon to get rid of it from the current puzzle","\n","^OOOOR you can drag it back into that grey void.","\n","^So many choices! What an era we live in, huh?","\n","^Anyways, that should cover most of the basics for ya, first timer!","\n","^The weather's sooo nice out today though.. It'd be a great day to go fishing.","\n","^Anyways, I guess I'll be seein ya later! Good luck on figuring these out!
